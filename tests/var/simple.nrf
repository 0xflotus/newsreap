# NRF files stand for NewsReap Filters and provide up to 3 kinds of filters:
#     B: Blacklist
#     W: Whitelist
#     S: Scorelist
#
# Scorelist (S) entries additionally requires a score as part of their type
# If no score is specified, then it is assumed to be assumed to be 100 (or +100)
#
# You can freely use hashtags to comment out entries in these files for
# documentation purposes.
#
# The second part of the code identifies what the regular expression should be
# applied against.
#
#  - The common 
#     S: Subject (default)
#     P: Poster
#
#  - The following are for whitelists and blacklists only:
#     >: Score Greater Than
#     <: Score Greater Than
#     =: Score Equals

# Scores are always applied first; since scoring doesn't directly impact the
# article itself, every score entry specified is applied.
#
# Blacklist any malicious content
